		<h2>We collect money and pass that money on to<br />provide beginning capital</h2>
		<p>
			We raise money by crowdfunding to buy properties and keep them out of the market, supporting a
			network of community-owned housing projects. Join our mission and donate a small amount each
			month to the Friends' shared fund, creating a better, more secure future for all.

				<h4 class="label">WHY WE ARE DOING IT</h4>
				<p>
					We aim to create autonomous housing groups to show how collective living can work. We
					believe housing should be rent-free and controlled by residents, with no need to pay
					landlords. Everyone deserves a secure home as a basic human right. Housing security is key
					to freedom. It allows us to focus more on helping our communities, caring for the
					environment, and building a more social society.
				</p>
				<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
					We only support initiatives, that are willing to commit to Ownership in Common, a legal
					agreement between the property-owning legal entity of a project, and an external party:
					either Friends in Common, or a third-party aligned with our mission.This agreement gives
					enough legal power to the external party to block the resale of the property, making it
					impossible for a Friends in Common supported property to return to the market.

				<h2>A legal contract to keep property off the market</h2>
				<p>
					Each group receiving money from Friends in Common will have to make a legal contract, with
					FIC or another organisation, that will make sure that the property will not become a
					commodity again. This is our way of building up the Commons - something that serves the
					community, is maintained by the community, and will not be exploited for profit.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cardTwo mosaicCard">
				<h2>Housing Should Be Free!</h2>
				<p>
					Housing should be as free today as inhabiting a cave would have been ten thousand years
					ago. Whatever buildings have been built, should be considered as common inheritance of
					humanity, to be used for the greatest good. If you're paying rent to inhabit your home,
					you're not free as the caveman was - you're in fact in a relationship similar to slavery
					with your landlord.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cardThree mosaicCard">
				<h2>Less housing stress leaves more time for political work</h2>
				<p>
					If your housing needs are covered, you'll have more capacities for political work.
					Donating money towards building the housing commons is therefore a way to support
					activists involved in important causes.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cardFour mosaicCard">
				<h2>Housing cooperatives are social hubs for a broader community</h2>
				<p>
					They offer culture and spaces for meeting, solidarity services and temporary stays for
					travelers. They are also neighborhood hubs, where locals get to know each other, building
					connections to the society outside of the political niche.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cardFive mosaicCard">
				<h2>With climate change, societal change is inevitable</h2>
				<p>
					There will eventually be massive shocks to the existing society through climate change,
					and adapting to the new conditions will be necessary for the individual as well as the
					collective. When we cannot reliably depend on the current structures of food and energy
					production, cooperation in every scale will become more important. It makes therefore
					sense to actively design new ways of providing our existential needs through cooperating.
					Additionally, the changes coming ahead will also require emotional and cultural
					adjustment, of which cooperative housing and collective care are sane answers.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cardSix mosaicCard">
				<h2>
					Permanence of residence is necessary for a healthy connection with the Earth and vibrant
					cities
				</h2>
				<p>
					When urban residents don't have stability of residence, they will engage less with their
					surroundings in positive and constructive ways. Gentrification is the process of
					un-rooting residents through increasing rents, causing the degradation of a lively city
					culture.
					<br />
					In a parallel effect, only by living for a longer time close to forests, fields, meadows and
					bodies of water can we observe their health and progression through the seasons.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cardSeven mosaicCard">
				<h2>Living with community is good for you</h2>
				<p>
					Living in close contact with people you share values with is one of the best things
					against the depressive, atomized, post-industrial world, where traditional, location-based
					social bonds have been devastated. Sharing meals, sharing care, sharing joys and
					frustrations with the people around you is the stuff of life.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cardEight mosaicCard">
				<h2>The Internet can be used to build social, economic networks</h2>
				<p>
					The Internet can be used for so much more than social media. It makes the transfer of
					money and information possible without geographic limitations. It makes the distribution
					of resources within a network possible. Using the Internet we can build economic strategy
					on a collective, international level, without the need for state planning and against the
					logic of an extraction-oriented market.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cardNine mosaicCard">
				<h2>A hopeful narrative</h2>
				<p>
					We're working towards a vision of the future that is more social, more ecological and more
					whole. We think this vision will inspire hope, and through participation in the
					crowdfunding campaing the members will feel empowered. Reading about successful projects
					will hopefully inspire more people to join and grow the network.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cardTen mosaicCard">
				<h2>Building a culture of the future</h2>
				<p>
					The long-term quest of Friends in Common is human liberation. We think that starting up
					hundreds of collectives with social-ecological values can have reverberations over time
					and over generations. Although it's not possible for us to have a say on the nature of
					future societies, it is possible in the present day to support communities, whose values
					we want to be passed on to future generations.
